# Sales Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

This repository contains a comprehensive project on sales data analysis and predictive modeling. The project leverages exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing techniques, and various regression algorithms to gain insights and predict sales performance.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project are:
- Perform in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and trends in sales data.
- Handle missing values using appropriate **central tendency measures**.
- Implement and compare various regression algorithms to develop an accurate predictive model.

## Key Features

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Visualized trends and correlations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
   - Discovered strong seasonality and a significant correlation between price and sales.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned the dataset by handling null values with mean/median imputation.
   - Prepared the data for modeling by normalizing and encoding features.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Implemented and evaluated multiple regression algorithms:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **Polynomial Regression**
     - **Lasso Regression**
     - **Ridge Regression**
   - Identified **Lasso Regression** as the best-performing model based on accuracy and error metrics.
